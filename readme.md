# Terraform Intro By Cloud Fusion

A simple and interactive kick-start into one of my favourite tools terraform. 

Go to part 1 to get started.


Side note: Terraform is not a perfect tool however its incredible well supported by all the major cloud providers and provides a declarative way of working with your infra.
From experience its so simple, adopted in nearly every software org and powerful it outways any cons.
